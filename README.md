## 🚀 Why Choose Allay?
Allay was born as an option to make dedicated Minecraft servers easy to configure, avoiding struggles like clientside mods, editing server.properties, and creating MOTDs. This project is made for those people who want a Minecraft server running on their own PC and don't know much about the technical aspects of editing TOML files and server.properties, managing log and crash files, or tips for port forwarding and more.
